We are `still` at the beginning of the biggest economical transformation driven by the world wide web. 

My goal is to shape this transformation to make our world better for our children. 

I believe in the open-world accessible to everyone. There are no technological, design, or speed limitations to do it.

I am interested in participating in challenging IT projects as a developer, software architect, or consultant.

I can contribute profoundly with know-how in the latest stack technology. I am specialized in [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org), [Redis](https://redis.io) NoSQL, Progressive Web with [material.io](https://material.io) components, and IoT backed by my long time IT experience.

I would be especially interested in developing applications complaint with the `WIA-ARIA` recommendations (Accessible Reach Internet Applications). 

You can reach me on my email emil@hearit.io
